# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This project is a minimal Webpack starter; the goal is to keep it simple and up to date.

## Development setup

1. Ensure Node.js >= 18 (LTS recommended) is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the dev server: `npm start`
4. Make your changes and verify `npm run build` succeeds.

## Project scope

- Keep dependencies minimal and modern (Webpack 5, Babel, Sass).
- Avoid framework-specific opinions (React/Vue/etc.) unless added as optional examples.

## Pull requests

1. Create a feature/fix branch.
2. Update or add documentation when you change behavior.
3. Ensure CI passes (Node 18/20) and builds succeed.
4. Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.

## Reporting issues

When filing an issue, include:

- Node and npm versions (`node -v`, `npm -v`).
- OS, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior.
- Any error logs from the console or CI.

## Releasing / Changelog

See CHANGELOG.md for notable changes. For dependency updates, summarize user-impacting changes and migration notes.
