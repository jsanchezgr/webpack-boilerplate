# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This is a simple starter; security updates are applied on a best-effort basis to the latest version only.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a private security advisory on GitHub or email the maintainer if available. Provide:

- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Suggested remediation if known

We will triage and respond as soon as possible.
